# InteractiveRestaurant

Application to automate the work in the restaurant.

Let's formulate the task - the restaurant director wants that:
1) on each table lay a tablet or whole table is interactive(IRT), which you can make an order through
2) while the order is being prepared, advertising is shown
3) at the end of the working day there must be an ability to operate different statistics
    a) the cook load
    b) the amount of revenue for orders
    c) the amount of revenue for showing ad

Let's highlight several features:
1)
- order created by the customer will be sent to the cook automatically
- the cook will cook it for some time and mark it as done
- after that the waiter will serve a dish
2)
- app will select desirable ad from the list
- and show this ad while dishes is cooking
- app must maximize advertising revenue
3)
- calculation of statistics
- display statistics to the director
